Rock-Paper-Scissors is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which
each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
These shapes are 'rock' (a closed fist), 'paper' (a flat hand),and 'scissors'
(a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a 'V').
It has three possible outcomes: a tie, a win or a loss. A player who decides
to play 'rock' will win another player who has chosen scissors ('rock smashes scissors'),
but will lose to one who has played paper ('paper covers rock'). A play of paper will lose
to a play of scissors ('scissors cuts paper'). If both players choose the same shape,
the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
